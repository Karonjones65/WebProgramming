    <h2> BodyBuilding Information That You Need! :) </h2><br>
    
    <p> Slow-to-no gains got you down? Here are four tips to reverse that trend and kick-start the muscle-building process.
      When it comes to gaining muscle, there are many contributing factors. Let's look at what you're doing that could potentially be holding you back in the gym.

1. You're Not Overtraining, You're Under-Recovering
Consider what weight training does to your body. By lifting weights, you are tearing down your muscles, so you don't gain muscle simply by lifting weights. You see gains only when you help your muscles recover from the work you do in the gym.
Recovery can come in many forms. In my opinion, there are three main areas of recovery that everyone should be aidingâ€”not only to gain muscle, but also if you want to improve your general health.
</p><br><br><br>

<p2> Nutrition
What you fuel your body with before and after your workouts will dictate how well you perform in the gym and whether or not you gain weight. If you eat like crap, you'll feel like crap. If you eat foods that provide your body with adequate amounts of nutrients, your muscles will recover from the weights and grow back fuller and stronger.
Mobility
Mobility isn't just for people who do yoga. Everyone can benefit from having better mobility. If you lift weights and don't pay any attention to improving and maintaining your joint range of motion, you're setting yourself up for injury. Adding mobility work to your routine consistently will help your body recover from training and lead to improvements in overall strength, health, and muscle gain.
Sleep
You cannot cheat your sleep. Period. Everyone has different schedules, but you should try to get at least seven hours of quality sleep every night. If you go to the gym feeling tired and sleep deprived, you won't perform as well as you would if you'd had a full night's sleep. Occasionally, you can get away with eating unhealthfully and still have a decent workout, but when you train on a bad night's sleep, there's no amount of caffeine that will help you. Lack of sleep will increase cortisol levels, which leads to more body fat and fewer muscle gains. So, get to bed!
</p2><br><br><br>

<p3>2. You're Focused On Testing Rather Than Building
Leave your ego at the gym door because it is holding you back from packing on muscle. A lot of people feel that they have to lift as much weight as they can. They want to test how strong they are today, rather than working on building their strength. They put more weight on the bar than they can handle and end up missing a lot of reps and failing their set. If you treat every workout like a competition, you are headed down a dead-end street. If you treat your workouts like building blocks that work together to achieve a greater goal, you will add muscle and get stronger.

To do that, you need to consider volume in your training plan. Volume is the total amount of weight you lift over the course of a workout. It's a key factor in your progress and an excellent illustration of why pushing max weights doesn't always bring max gains.

Let's say you get to the gym and it's bench day. You put 135 pounds on the bar and start your workout. On the first set, you complete 10 reps. On the second set, you get 7, and on the third set, you manage 4 reps until someone has to pry the bar off your chest. You have successfully completed 21 reps, which is a total volume of 2,835 pounds (135 x 21 = 2,835).
